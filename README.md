Overview of the project

project:SIMPLE CALCULATOR
        Project Purpose:
                         The goal is to build a command-line calculator that allows users to perform arithmetic calculations.
                        Weâ€™ll focus on addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
        Core Features and Functionality:
                Mathematical Operations:
                        Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input.
                Input Validation:
                        Ensure valid numerical inputs and handle any errors gracefully.
                Interactive User Interface:
                        Create a text-based interface for users to select operations and enter values.
                Continuous Operation:
                        Allow users to perform multiple operations in succession.
                Error Handling:
                        Provide informative messages for invalid operations or inputs (e.g., division by zero).
                Project Boundaries and Limitations:
                        The calculator will operate in a command-line environment (no GUI).
                        It wonâ€™t support advanced mathematical functions or graphing capabilities.
                Building the Basic Calculator:
                         Start incrementally, focusing on one functionality at a time.
                         Use try-except blocks for error handling.
                         Keep the interface user-friendly with clear instructions and feedback.
                Step-by-Step Implementation:
                        Step 1: Define the Calculator Class
                        Create a class that handles user input, performs calculations, and displays results.
